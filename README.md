### **Learning Summary** 

* /**Data collection**/ forms the backbone of our project. We have used Javascript objects to store product data with different fields - product URL, name, image, product price, offer, etc.   
&emsp; We have utilized Local Storage to store cart data, wishlist data, and user data during the user browsing session. We use these data to populate the wishlist page and cart page with appropriate products. 

* /**Event listeners**/ are crucial in making the website dynamic and responsive. mouseover, mouseout, click, change  

* /**Grid and Flex layouts**/ are used extensively throughout the website to draw complex div layouts and page structures. Both these layouts enable us to add media queries to the pages to create a responsive web layout.  

* /**CSS Selectors and Combinators**/ used in the site have simplified navigating through the long nested divs structures without adding separate ids for every Html element or tag.     

* /**Creating HTML through JavaScript**/ helped us in populating the pages from JSON data objects with map and forEach function in javascript. We also learned how to attach CSS classes with JS.
